Since 1.4 the skin selector now works differently and requires manual intervention.

Now to change the skin you need to go to the mod folder and follow the path "Textures/WVC/KL_Races". There are 5 folders there.

Default - skins for Valkyries and Gaurkyries are taken from here
ELF_Default - same but for ELFs

These folders are used for race, by default.

To change skins for races, you first need to enable the skin selector. This will change skin paths for all 3 races.

ELFs - folder for ELFs skins
Valks - for Valkyries
Gaur - for Gaurkyries

Select the skins you need from the folders named "Default" and copy them to the appropriate folders.
Please note that the names of the skins must be in this order!

Skin_north (_east _west _south)
Skin1_north
Skin2_north

If you mix up or miss the number, then the skin simply will not be displayed.

Q: Why such a radical and uncomfortable change?
A: Skins for girls have been rewritten from scratch, now body addons are used instead of bodies. This is done to allow girls to use clothes without restrictions and visual bugs. It also solves the problem with displaying sleeping girls.

Do not delete anything from the Default folder or it will cause errors!
