				<text>About girls:\n\n&lt;color=#a2c8ff&gt;Valkyries - They can do everything normal pawns can do. Have psi abilities, build, craft, get royal titles, etc. That is, to be full-fledged pawns. Valkyries have several subspecies. The settings of the Valkyries and their subspecies are located in the "KL" tab.&lt;/color&gt;\n\n&lt;color=#f5ffa2&gt;Gaurkyries - a subspecies of the Valkyries and therefore inherits most of the settings and parameters from them. They have the abilities of the Gauranlen tree. Gaurkyries settings can be found in the "KL" tab.&lt;/color&gt;\n\n&lt;color=#a2adff&gt;ELF - a subspecies of the Valkyries. They are weak in combat and significantly inferior in strength to the Valkyries, however, they are better at tending wounds and better at any job. They have unique skins.&lt;/color&gt;\n\n&lt;color=#ffcea2&gt;Royal Dryads (Dryad Girls) - are dryads that have a girl skin, they are basically more effective than ordinary dryads, but do not completely replace them.&lt;/color&gt;\n\nInfo:\n&lt;color=#FFE66F&gt;- Thanks to rot03065  for permission to use the girls from IG! This allows Valkyries to have the appearance of Insect Girls.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;color=#64b8ff&gt;\n- Thanks to Psyche for permission to use the girls from the "kemomimihouse" mod!&lt;/color&gt;&lt;color=#c8c8ff&gt;\n- Thanks to 死萌 for permission to use the Mimikko girls!&lt;/color&gt;</text>
